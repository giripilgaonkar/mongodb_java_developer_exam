Download handout containing albums.json and images.json collection
Start your mongo server.
Navigate to the path where handout is downloaded and extracted.
Use mongoimport command to create collection from these two json file as below
> mongoimport -d final7 -c albums albums.json

> mongoimport -d final7 -c images images.json

This will create both collections in final7 database.
Start mongo shell and connect to final7 database using following command
> use final7

To speed up your queries, add index on albums collection as
> db.albums.ensureindex( { images : 1 } )

Write your python program to get required output as below
import pymongo

con = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost")

db = con.final7 
images = db.images 
albums = db.albums

cursor = images.find({}, {'_id': 1})

for c in cursor: 
 image_id = c['_id'] 
 image_in_albums = albums.find_one({'images': image_id})

if not image_in_albums: 
 images.remove({'_id': image_id})

print 'compeleted'

Execute this python program. On successful execution, it will delete all orphan images
To check if all orphan images are deleted, executed command
> db.images.find().count()

It will return number of documents as 89737.
To find your answer, execute following command on your mongo shell connected to final7 database
> db.images.find({tags:”kittens”}).count()

You will get your answer as 44787
